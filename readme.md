## About
This application has come to life as a full stack software developer school's exam project. It wishes to help in maintenace of various properties, like flats, houses, premises, vehicles an so on. Helps to collect informaitions, todo lists in one place.  
In the first milestone two modules has build: activities and machines.  
In planned future milestones will contains further modules, like cleaning, inspections, inventory, administration & billing, animal and plant maintenance.  
The goal is help to optimise maintenance things to do, to minimize time requirements and maximize performance by making them planned and preventing from forget something.  
There is a Figma wireframe in the root of the repository. It made alongside of user stories, and it contains the basic design of frontend application too.  


## Getting started: Install app
**The project's backend part is runnable by cloning the repository and follow this steps**
### Clone repository
### Install Node JS and Node Package Manager on your computer
### Install project's dependencies (root directory)
Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/){:target="_blank"}  
```
$ npm install
```
It will install all dependencies collected in package.json

### Register app on Google Developer Console
For the OpenId signup and login processes application needs to be registered on Google Developer Console. The received credentials has to be saved into environmental variable(s) as seen below.  
[Tutorial](https://breadbutter.io/how-to-set-up-google-openid-connect/){:target="_blank"}  
- scpoes needed: .../auth/userinfo.email, .../auth/userinfo.profile, openid  
- It's important that Google Dev console credentials, backend's environmental variables and frontend's config.ts file all contains the same values

### Set up a MoongoDB database
It can be locally, using MongoDB Compass desktop application, or can be online via MongoDB Atlas. Set connection string as environmental variable (see below).

- [MongoDB Atlas tutorial](https://www.mongodb.com/basics/mongodb-atlas-tutorial){:target="_blank"}  

### Set environmental variables
Before use the application, required to set the following environmental variablaes. If app runs locally put all into a .env file in the root directory:

| Key             | Value                                                                                                            |
| :---            | :---                                                                                                             |
| PORT            | Defines the port that the application listens.                                                                   |
| SERVER_ADDRESS  | Just a note, application not using it. Don't delete field and value, it ruins the validation.                    |
| CLIENT_ID       | A Google credential that given as a part of the Dev Console registration process.                                |
| CLIENT_SECRET   | A Google credential that given as a part of the Dev Console registration process.                                |
| REDIRECT_URI    | A Google credential that need to be set as a part of the registration pocess.                                    |
| JWT_SECRET_KEY  | Required for the signing process off json web tokens. Could be any string, but suggested to be a 256 bit string. |
| MONGO_DB_URL    | MongoDB database connection string.                                                                              |

**If you walked along all above steps, the application is ready to use. See scripts below.**


## Available Scripts
**In the project directory, you can run:**
### `npm run dev`
Starts te application in developer mode
### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder
### `npm run start`
Starts te builded application (npm run build command has to be executed before)
### `npm test`
Runs all of the definied tests with Jest and Supertest. The results will seen on the console.


## Usage
A few minutes after server application is started either by npm start or npm run dev, the console prints the following messages:  
```
‚ö°Ô∏è Landlord Server is running at http://localhost:3003  
üìÄ Landlord Database is connected  
```
It means that the server is ready to use.  
In case of errors, the server uses the console to indicate them, and also send apprpriat responses to the client side.  
#### OpenAPI 3.0 (Swagger) documentation
There is an api documentation in the root of the repository and it is served too by the server at /api/docs endpoint.  
If it needs to be updated or corrected, there is need to save the new version in json and yaml formats and with the same name and place.
